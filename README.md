Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause illness in people, and others that circulate among mammals and birds. The case fatality rate is approximately 2.3% (based on initial information).

The aim of this project is to provide a graphical interpretation of the statistics of Coronavirus all over the world. The data source for the project is the Worldometer website. The data is then visualised through graphs which provides a better understanding.
